- B) A loud alarm that warns everyone it's fake
- C) A broken telephone that doesn't work
- D) A mean person who wants to trick everyone

**Hint for wrong answers:** Remember from Chapter 2 - the story says misinformation is tricky because it looks just like real, true information, and people often share it because they genuinely believe it's true and want to help!

**Correct answer praise:** Great detecting! You spotted that misinformation can look just like the real thing.

- A) They always followed health recommendations perfectly
- B) They were much better at spotting fake information âœ“ (Correct)
- C) They never got sick during COVID-19
- D) They became real detectives when they grew up

**Hint for wrong answers:** Look back at Chapter 4, Discovery #1! The story mentions that people with more science education were better at something specific, even if they didn't always follow recommendations exactly.

**Correct answer praise:** Nice work! More science learning helped people tell what's real from what's fake.

### Question 3: What did the scientists call the brain's "Careful Way" of thinking about information?
- A) The Peripheral Route
- B) The Quick Route
- C) The Central Route âœ“ (Correct)

**Hint for wrong answers:** Check Chapter 5 again! The story explains that the "Careful Way" has a special scientific name. It's the way where you ask questions, look for evidence, and really think like a detective!

**Correct answer praise:** Brilliant! That's the Central Routeâ€”the careful, evidence-first thinking of super detectives.
