Quiz Questions: Draw Like a Scientist
Question 1
What are the main steps in the "Draw Like a Scientist" technique that the researchers taught to children?

 A) Color the drawing with bright colors, add labels, and show it to friends
 B) Draw from memory, use imagination, and make it look pretty
 C) Trace the plant with your finger, look back and forth between the plant and drawing, and focus on what you actually see
 D) Draw as fast as possible, use lots of details, and copy other children's drawings
Correct Answer: C

Hint: Remember from "The Magic Technique" section! The story explains that the teacher showed children how to trace over the plant photo with her finger, and emphasized looking back and forth between the photograph and the drawing. The technique was all about drawing what you actually see, not what you think you should see.

Question 2
What amazing discovery did the researchers make after teaching children the "Draw Like a Scientist" technique?

 A) All children became professional artists
 B) Children's drawings became much more accurate and included parts they had missed before
 C) Children only wanted to draw plants from then on
 D) Children stopped using their imagination completely
Correct Answer: B

Even 10 weeks later, they still remembered how to draw more accurately!

Correct Answer: B

Hint: Check out "Why This Discovery Matters" section! The story explains that when kids learn to observe carefully and draw what they actually see, they're developing "superpowers" like detective skills for noticing tiny details, communication powers, thinking tools, and scientific confidence. These skills help them in all kinds of science learning!
